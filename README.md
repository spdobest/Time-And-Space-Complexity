# TimeAndSpaceComplexity
  
**In this tutorial i am going to explain the time and space complexity in any program. I will cover the below Topics in this Tutorial.**  
  
**1. Time Complexity**
**2. Space Complexity**
**3. Programs and their Time Complexity**  
**4. Types of time complexity**
**5. What is the use of Time Complexity**  
  
### What is Time Complexity  
In simple word, total time require to execute a program or a block of code is known as the time complexity.We can analyze the type of time complexity using the **ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS**.  
    
### Asymptotic Analysis  
It is the method of describing the limiting (best, average and worst ) behavior of any programming operation.  
The main Objective of Asymptotic Analysis is to measure of efficiency of the program.

There are three types of Asymptotoc Analysis  
**1. Best case**    - Which is most desirable situation which takes **minimum** time required to execute the program.     
**2. Average case** - It is average desirable situation - the **average time** required to execute the program.     
**3. Worst Case**   - It is not desirable situation at all. The **maximum time** required to execute the program.  
  
### Asymptotic Notation  
By using asymptotic notation we will calculate the running time required to execute the program.

There are three types of **ASYMPTOTIC NOTATION**  
**1. Ο (Big Oh) Notation -** It describes the performance of the program. Big O describes the worst-case scenario i.e the longest amount of time taken to execute the program.    
**2. Ω (Omega) Notation -**  Omega describes the best-case scenario i.e the best amount of time taken to execute the program.  
**3. θ (theta)Notation -** Theta describes the both best case scenario and worst-case scenario  of a program running time.  
  
**Now i will explain Big O notation with each exmaple and its use**
