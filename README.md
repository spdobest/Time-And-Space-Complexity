# TimeAndSpaceComplexity
  
**In this tutorial i am going to explain the time and space complexity in any program. I will cover the below Topics in this Tutorial.**  
  
**1. Time Complexity**
**2. Space Complexity**
**3. Programs and their Time Complexity**  
**4. Types of time complexity**
**5. What is the use of Time Complexity**  
  
### What is Time Complexity  
In simple word, total time require to execute a program or a block of code is known as the time complexity. There are 3 types of time complexity.  
  
1. **Best case**    - Which is most desirable situation which takes **minimum** time required to execute the program.     
**2. Average case** - It is average desirable situation - the **average time** required to execute the program.     
**3. Worst Case**   - It is not desirable situation at all. The **maximum time** required to execute the program.     
  
### Asymptotic Analysis  
It is the method of describing the limiting (best, average and worst ) behavior of any programming operation.  
The main Objective of Asymptotic Analysis is to measure of efficiency of the program.
